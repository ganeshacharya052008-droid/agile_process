Scrum is an Agile project management framework that organizes work into short, time-boxed iterations called sprints (typically 1–4 weeks). It is designed to help teams collaborate, adapt quickly to change, and deliver value incrementally. Created in the early 1990s by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, Scrum is widely used in software development but is also applied in marketing, R&D, and other complex project environments.
